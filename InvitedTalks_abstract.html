        <span style="font-size: 1rem;">Computational needs of applications such as machine learning are increasing in orders of magnitude while node scaling provides small percentage improvements per year. Proof-of-concepts (PoCs) with key architectural ideas and a known set of system IPs demonstrate power, performance, and area (PPA) benefits better than a full custom designed support IPs. Development of support designs in addition to the focus of research may also be beyond the strength of many architectural teams.<br>
          <br>Open-source approach to silicon development provides a push for innovation by helping research and commercial teams focus on their custom designs while reusing on the building block IPs from the ecosystem. Such a reuse is also helpful for incremental development for software stack to go with the hardware. These research ideas can be developed and implemented where they benefit the most in the architecture from large data centers through small IoT devices.<br>
          <br>This talk focuses on a spectrum of technologies from GlobalFoundries and a suite of IPs and tools from the proprietary and open-source ecosystem can be used to explore novel architecture ideas and create silicon designs to test power, performance, and area efficiencies on their applications.
